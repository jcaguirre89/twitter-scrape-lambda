## About
Python lambda function that uses the Twitter Search API to get the 500 most recent tweets for a given query, and returns a list of tokens---after removing punctuation, stopwords and the query itself.

## Local development
requires the `python-lambda` package, which you can install with `pip`. Also requires a `.env` file with the Twitter API keys that you can create in their "developer" site.
